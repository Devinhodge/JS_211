Use a do...while loop to console.log the numbers from 1 to 1000.

Create an object (an array with keys and values) called person with the following data:
firstName: "Jane"
lastName: "Doe"
birthDate: "Jan 5, 1925"
gender: "female"

Use a for...in loop and if statement to console.log the value associated with the key birthDate if the birth year is an odd number.

Create an arrayOfPersons that contains multiple objects. You can simply copy/paste the person object you made above multiple times. Feel free to change the values to reflect multiple people you might have in your database.

Use .map() to map over the arrayOfPersons and console.log() their information.

Use .filter() to filter the persons array and console.log only males in the array.

Use .filter() to filter the persons array and console.log only people that were born before Jan 1, 1990.
