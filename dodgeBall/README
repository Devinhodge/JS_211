We are in need of a sorting and organizing app for our community dodge ball league. 
There are already 6 players signed up and we hope to get more! 
We need to select from our currently signed-up people to make them dodge ball players,
and from there we need to be able to select them to be on different teams. 
Please look over the Specs Checklist to make sure you understand the needs of this app.

20pts - Can add People to Players - When clicked the people are added to the Players column and removed from the People list while getting new values of a player added to them.
