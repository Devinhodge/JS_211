TOWERS OF HANOI

4 Disks [1, 2, 3, 4]
3 Stacks [a, b, c]

Only 1 disk can be moved at a time
No larger disk may be placed on a smaller disk

If a disk is on a another disk, then all disks below must have a > value, 
else the stack is empty.

The disk starts on one stack, and has a choice of two to choose from for a move.

To WIN, all disks must be on stack B or stack C 
IF there are ANY disks on stack A, the game is NOT complete. 



Starting Point is stack A
